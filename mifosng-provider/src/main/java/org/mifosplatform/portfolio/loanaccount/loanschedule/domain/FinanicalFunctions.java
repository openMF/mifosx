     * (expressed as a fraction, not a percentage, i.e., divide the quoted
     * yearly percentage rate by 100 and by 12 to obtain the monthly interest
     * rate), the number of monthly payments N called the loan's term, and the
     * amount borrowed P known as the loan's principal; c is given by the
